Summary: Coverage, data freshness, classification, entity resolution, alpha measurement, and known gaps. How we build structured intelligence from municipal public records.

## Coverage

We monitor 2,100+ municipalities across 50 states. The United States has 19,500 municipalities. Our coverage is concentrated in New England, the Midwest, and the Mountain West, expanding weekly through automated onboarding.

**What we cover well today:**

- Municipal meeting documents (agendas, minutes, packets) from 2,100+ municipalities
- Check registers and accounts payable data from 200+ municipalities
- Building permits from 400+ municipalities (40,000+ structured records)
- Tower and infrastructure lease data from assessor records (4,700+ sites screened)
- FOAA/FOIA response data from 100+ jurisdictions with active records requests

**Known coverage gaps:**

- County-level data (recorder, probate, assessor) is early stage -- depth in Maine and New Hampshire, limited elsewhere
- Western and Southern states are underrepresented relative to New England and Midwest
- Insurance rate filings and mineral rights data are in pilot phase
- Real-time check register feeds exist for a minority of covered municipalities -- most are periodic via records requests

We are transparent about where our coverage is strong and where it is thin. If you need data from a specific jurisdiction, [ask](/contact/) -- we can often onboard a new municipality in days.

## Data Freshness

The pipeline runs daily. Every covered municipality is crawled, new documents are classified, and entities are resolved against the knowledge graph.

- **Document ingestion:** Daily for web-published documents. Varies for FOAA/FOIA responses (depends on jurisdiction response times, typically 5-10 business days)
- **Signal classification:** Same-day. Documents ingested in the evening crawl are classified and available by morning
- **Entity resolution:** Same-day. New vendor names are matched against the ticker database during classification
- **Tower/infrastructure data:** Weekly census. FCC and FAA cross-referencing runs on a weekly cycle

## Source Types

| Source | Method | Typical Latency |
|---|---|---|
| Municipal agendas and minutes | Automated collection (CivicPlus, Granicus, BoardDocs, custom) | Same-day |
| Check registers / AP data | FOAA/FOIA records requests + web collection where available | 5-30 days (records request) or same-day (web) |
| Building permits | Web collection + records requests | Same-day to 30 days |
| Assessor records | Records requests + GIS portal collection | 5-30 days |
| FCC/FAA tower data | Federal database cross-reference | Weekly |
| Insurance rate filings | State DOI portal collection | Same-day (pilot) |

All data is sourced from publicly available government records or obtained through formal public records requests. We do not access authentication-gated, paywalled, or restricted content. See our [data sourcing policy](/legal/privacy/) for details.

## Classification

Documents are classified by a multi-provider LLM classifier into 14 canonical document types (agenda, minutes, check_register, budget, capital_plan, ordinance, permit, rfp, legislative_document, and others) and assigned an investment priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW).

**Pre-classification noise filtering:** Before the LLM sees a document, a rules-based filter applies 70+ patterns to remove non-signal documents (newsletters, police blotters, election results, blank forms, recreational schedules). Each pattern is derived from data analysis requiring 20+ matching documents with a 0% signal rate. Tower and wireless documents are exempt from noise filtering.

**What "HIGH priority" means:** The document contains information that maps directly to a public company ticker, infrastructure asset, or fiscal health indicator. Examples: a check register payment to a publicly-traded contractor, a tower lease renewal on a planning board agenda, a budget amendment showing a revenue shortfall.

**What the classifier does not do:** It does not make investment recommendations, predict price movements, or assign sentiment. It structures facts from public documents and resolves entities. The signal is the structured data itself.

## Entity Resolution

Vendor names in municipal documents are messy. "Waste Management of Maine," "WM," "Waste Mgmt," and "WASTE MANAGEMENT INC" are the same company (ticker: WM). Our entity resolution system maps these variations to canonical company names and public tickers.

**Two-tier architecture:**

- **Tier 1 (Watchlist):** Curated ticker-company pairs. Exact string matching. High confidence. Primary source for trading signals.
- **Tier 2 (Discovery):** Broader matching against subsidiary names, DBAs, and known aliases. Substring and fuzzy matching. Medium confidence. Stored for validation and portfolio expansion.

Current resolution covers 100+ public company tickers across 2,100+ municipalities. Resolution accuracy varies by entity -- large, frequently-appearing companies (AT&T, Verizon, Waste Management) resolve at high accuracy. Smaller or regional companies may not resolve on first appearance and are queued for review.

**Known limitation:** Entity confidence is currently expressed as a tier label, not a numeric probability score. Numeric confidence scoring is planned.

## Investment Vectors

Each classified document is evaluated against 12 proprietary investment vectors spanning vendor relationships, infrastructure assets, regulatory patterns, real estate dynamics, and fiscal health indicators. A single document may generate signals across multiple vectors.

Vector definitions and example signals are available under NDA. [Contact us](/contact/?subject=Investment%20vector%20details) to learn more.

## Alpha Measurement

We measure the relationship between our signals and subsequent stock returns. This section describes the methodology for transparency, not as a performance guarantee.

**Approach:** For each signal with a resolved ticker, we compute excess returns over SPY and sector-specific ETFs at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12-week horizons.

**Document-level deduplication:** A single check register may mention 10+ companies. Treating each ticker-document pair as independent inflates sample size and overstates significance. We compute the median excess return per document, yielding one observation per document. Both raw pair counts and effective n (unique documents) are reported.

**Statistical framework:** t-statistics, Sharpe ratios, and excess returns computed per document type and vector. Significance threshold: |t| >= 2.0 (approximately 95% confidence).

**Current status:** Preliminary results show statistically significant positive excess returns for legislative documents, capital plans, and budgets at short horizons. Check registers show slightly negative excess returns after proper deduplication -- an earlier analysis that did not deduplicate at the document level overstated their effect. Results are based on limited history and should be treated as preliminary.

A detailed methodology paper is available on request for quantitative analysts evaluating the data. [Contact us](/contact/).

## Quality Controls

- **Automated expectations:** Minimum active municipalities, signal volume stability, valid classification rates, entity extraction rates -- checked after every daily run
- **Regression testing:** Golden set of 80+ pre-classified signals verified after any classifier, navigator, or schema change
- **Noise filter validation:** Every pattern requires 20+ matching documents with 0% signal rate before deployment
- **Self-healing pipeline:** Automated health checks, structural drift detection, and remediation

## What We Don't Do

- We don't access paywalled or subscription-only data sources
- We don't use social media, news, or web traffic data
- We don't make investment recommendations or predictions
- We don't sell data that isn't derived from public records
- We don't access non-public government systems -- everything we structure is published by governments for public consumption or obtained through formal records requests

## Data Dictionary

A complete data dictionary covering all data products (signals, entity sightings, municipal receivables, permit records, tower/infrastructure data, contagion events) is available on request. Each field includes type, description, update frequency, and example values.
